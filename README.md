### **Getting started with Serverless - 4 Easy Patterns**

There's a project directory for each pattern:

- Data Processing
- Simple Web Service
- Fan-Out

&nbsp;

### **Deploying a service**

- Sign in to AWS via [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html)

- `cd` into a service

- Run `npm install`

- Run `sls deploy` to deploy the service

- Watch your stack come to life in the AWS console! ðŸŽ‰

Each service was created with a Serverless Framework template.

Run `serverless create --template aws-nodejs` in a new direcrtory to create your own services.
